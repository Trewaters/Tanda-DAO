Tanda DAO [version 1.0.0](https://badge.fury.io/hooks/github)

[Ethereum Denver 2023](https://www.ethdenver.com/)

Tanda DAO allows members to join Pacts, which are contractual agreements among members. A Pact obligates each member to pay an agreed-upon amount for an agreed upon time. Each member gets a set lump sum payout once until everyone is paid back.

Tanda DAO is for the economically disadvantaged. Anyone who lives paycheck-to-paycheck could use this.

## Getting Started

* Create your [Wallet](https://), or connect a new ETH wallet (recommended).
* Connect a Lens profile to Tanda DAO.
* Join a League funding level.
* Pick a Cycle of time.
* Create a new Pact for your comrades.

It is just that simple!

Imagine you are in a financial emergency and need money now! You could form a Tanda DAO pact with your comrades and get the first payout. Your comrades are willing to accept that level of risk because they "trust" your Lens linked profile.

EXAMPLE:
