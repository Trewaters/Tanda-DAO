Tanda DAO allows members to join **Pacts**. Pacts are agreements among members, we call **comrades**. A Pact obligates each comrade to pay the agreed-upon amount for an agreed upon period of time, called a **cycle**. Each member gets a set lump sum payout once until everyone is paid back.

Tanda DAO is for the economically disadvantaged. Anyone who lives paycheck-to-paycheck could use this.

### Git Branches explained

**"[main](https://github.com/Trewaters/Tanda-DAO)"** branch is for development of the front end to Tanda DAO.

Run `npm run dev` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:3000/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

**"[bagelsProto](https://github.com/Trewaters/Tanda-DAO/tree/bagelsProto)"** branch is for prototyping the solidity contract. I would like to learn Polygon too because it is more cost effective. [bagels](https://github.com/Alex-Neo-Projects/bagels) is a solidity scaffolding project in alpha. I heard about it at ETH Denver 2023. Join their Discord and help this two dev OSS project buidl. Slides from their [presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Vu4-oC52tJloBiP8bzF1oEgv2dQiuGFWVwyaRIZCSX0/edit#slide=id.g2111c514ece_0_7).

type: `bagels` in the root directory of the project. Window to `http://localhost:9091/` will open to view the contract prototype and GUI.

**"[t3Frontend](https://github.com/Trewaters/Tanda-DAO/tree/t3Frontend)"** is for prototyping the front end to Tanda DAO. Uses the Next.js React framework.

The constitution list the user rights and obligations, while the social contract is an agreement to be civil and work as a community/organization/group when concerning DAO matters. This is a living document that can be changed by the DAO members.

**Credit Score, Trustworthiness Rating**
The DAO will have a credit score for each member. This score will be based on the number of Pacts they have completed and the number of strikes they have. This score will be used to determine if a member can join a Pact.
